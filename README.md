# Transcriptologs
Transcriptologs is a python software for the detection of orthology relationships based on transcript sequences of two different species.
Transcriptologs takes as input files the results of two tBLASTx all-versus-all output files (for example the results of a human-vs-mouse
tBLASTx and a mouse-vs-human tBLASTx). This software gives as output a file of orthology relationships between all the genes of the two
considered species.
Python version 3.3 or above is required.
